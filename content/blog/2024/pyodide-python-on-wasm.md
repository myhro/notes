There's a Python port to WebAssembly (WASM) called [Pyodide][pyodide]. It even includes a REPL on their website, where a [Python shell can be spun up in a browser][console].

JavaScript is already available in a browser console, but having the entire Python standard library accessible in a browser could still be useful.
