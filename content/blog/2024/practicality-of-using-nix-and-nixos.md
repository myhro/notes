title: Practicality of using Nix and NixOS

A thoughtful write-up about whether it makes sense to use NixOS for those who appreciate the Nix package manager: [Don't use NixOS][dont]. This perspective certainly resonates with my own experience. I started with Nix on top of Debian, moved to NixOS, and eventually gave up on it, opting to stick with just Nix on both Debian and macOS.
