A little over 10 years ago, I mentioned to my boss at the time that I didn't like Ubuntu very much, especially for servers. The main issue was that I would usually find bugs that weren't present in Debian. What I had no idea about back then was that in the next decade, Ubuntu would also contain security issues that weren't present in Debian: https://gld.mcphail.uk/posts/ubuntu-security-updates-are-a-confusing-mess/

The main problem is that without an Ubuntu Pro subscription, not all packages in an LTS system will receive security updates.
