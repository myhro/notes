title: AI-powered coding workflows

A nice write-up on how to both create new projects and maintain existing ones that rely heavily on the currently available LLM/AI tools: [My LLM codegen workflow atm][codegen-workflow].

The two main things that caught my attention were [Aider][aider], which I wasn't previously aware of, and the idea of writing an architecture/planning document to be referenced continuously. That concept is similar to [creating a Cursor rules file and linking to reference documentation][wordpress-cursor].
